TechLabs DÃ¼sseldorf - AI Track Summer 2022

Mentor: Nikolai Arras

Initially, we aimed to build a German Sign Language Translator that could be used in medical environments.
During the project work, it became apparent the preliminary goal was too extensive & could not be realized in the given time frame.
Accordingly, we have adjusted the scope of our project & focused on translating the static alphabet of German Sign Language.

In this repository you will find our notebook as well as the data we used.
